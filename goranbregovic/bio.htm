				<p align=right><b>[ Goran BREGOVIC and his Wedding and Funeral Band ]</b></p>
				<p align=center><b><a href="bio.htm">English</a> | <a href="biofr.htm">Français</a> | <a href="bioesp.htm">Español</a> | <a href="bioit.htm">Italiano</a> | <a href="biode.htm">Deutsche</a></b></p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roots in the Balkans where he stems from, head in the 21st Century which he fully inhabits, Goran Bregovic's music 
				marries sounds of a gypsy brass band with traditional Bulgarian polyphonies, those of a guitar and traditional percussion with a curious rock accent…. 
				all against a background of a bedevilled string orchestra and deep sonorities of a male choir, creating music that our soul recognises instinctively and 
				the body greets with an irresistible urge to dance.<br><br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born in Sarajevo of a Serbian mother and a Croatian father. After a few years of (very unenthusiastic) music studies 
				at the conservatory (violin), Goran forms his first group &quot;The White Button&quot; at the age of sixteen. Composer and guitar player (&quot;I chose 
				the guitar because guitar players always have most success with girls&quot;), 
				he admits his immoderate love for rock n'roll. &quot;In those times, Rock 
				had a capital role in our lives. It was the only way we could make our voice 
				heard, and publicly express our discontent without risking jail (or just about)...&quot;<br><br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Studies of philosophy and sociology 
				would most certainly have landed him teacher of Marxist thought, had the gigantic 
				success of his first record not decided otherwise. Follow fifteen years with 
				his group &quot;The White Button&quot;, marked by marathon-tours and endless 
				sessions of autographing in which Goran plays youth idol in Eastern countries 
				until he's sick and tired of it.<br><br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the eighties BREGOVIC 
    			takes time away from this permanent hustle-bustle to compose music for Kusturica's 
    			&quot;Times of the Gypsies&quot;, and to make his childhood dream come true: 
    			to live in a small house on the Adriatic coast. The War in Yugoslavia shatters 
    			this, and many other dreams, and Goran has to abandon everything to find exile in Paris… </font></p>

				<p align=center><b>Music for Movies</b></p>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming from the same background, 
    			the same generation, survivors of the same experiences, Goran BREGOVIC and 
    			Emir KUSTURICA formed a tandem which didn't need words to communicate. After 
    			&quot;Times of the Gypsies&quot; Goran had a free hand to compose the original 
    			soundtrack for &quot;Arizona Dream&quot;. The music lives up to the film - 
			    poetical, original and incredibly enhancing. &quot;One of the great things 
			    about Emir's movies is that they show life exactly as it is - full of holes, 
			    hesitations and unexpected events. It's this imperfect, unorganised side that 
			    I wanted to preserve above all. Even the songs recorded with Iggy are very 
			    under-produced. There's just his voice and behind it a gypsy-orchestra blowing 
			    into old pre-war trumpets and cow's horns. It's really very simple.&quot; 
    			What Goran doesn't say is that it's probably one of Iggy's best performances 
    			over the past ten years. What he doesn't say either is that this apparent 
    			simplicity belongs only to artists of exceptional talent.<br><br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patrice Chereau entrusts him with 
    			the music for &quot;La Reine Margot&quot;, Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival 
    			in 1994. Goran delivers a majestic piece with rock accents.<br><br>
				The music for Emir Kusturica's &quot;Underground&quot;, Palme d'Or at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival, was 
				also signed by Goran. But not the following film. A three year collaboration 
				on &quot;Underground&quot; has worn everyone out and Emir has to find a whole 
				new team for his next film &quot;White Cat Black Cat&quot;.<br><br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently Goran composed spicy music 
    			with a &quot;kletzmer&quot; aroma for the &quot;Train de Vie&quot; of Radu 
    			MIHAELANU acclaimed by the critics in Venice, Sao Paulo, Berlin and by the 
    			public everywhere it was shown. He has since devoted himself to the interpretation 
    			of his own music and lent himself to a second stage-career. Without, however, 
    			completely abandoning the movies : Nana DJORDJAZE &quot; 27 Missing Kisses 
    			&quot; in 2001, Unni STRAUME &quot; Music for Weddings &amp; Funerals &quot; 
    			in 2002 (music and main masculine part).<br><br></p>
				
  				<p align=center><b>Music for Theatre</b></p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Silence of the Balkans&quot; 
    			was a very ambitious multimedia project performed in 1997 at Thessaloniki, 
    			under the direction of Slovenian Tomaz PANDUR with video images by Boris MILJKOVIC. 
				Then a collaboration with Teatro Stabile from Trieste for whom he wrote 
			    the stage music for a very unusual &quot;Hamlet&quot;, and Goran Bregovic 
			    starts enjoying writing for the theatre. Follows a collaboration with one 
			    of the most &quot;in&quot; Italian directors, Marco BAILANI for whom, commissioned 
			    by the Festival NOVECENTO in Palermo, he writes the music for &quot;The Children's 
			    Crusade&quot; (created November 1999). Recently Bregovic wrote music for a 
			    stage setting of Dante's &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; (conceived as a triptych, 
			    of which the first part Inferno was premiered at the THALIA THEATRE in Hamburg 
			    in January 2001, followed in February 2002 by Purgatory and Paradise). The 
			    director is Goran's long time work complice, Tomaz PANDUR from Slovenia.</font></p>
				
				<p align=center><b>Music live</b></p>
  				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For over ten years, since he abandoned 
    			pure rock in 1985, the music of BREGOVIC had never been performed live. This 
			    all changes in 1995 when, with a band of ten traditional musicians, a choir 
			    of fifty singers and a symphonic orchestra, he undertakes a series of concerts 
			    in Greece and Sweden followed by the concert given October 26th at the Forest 
			    National of Brussels for an audience of 7500. Very few gigs in 1996 as the 
			    idea of a hundred and twenty performers on stage scared organisers.<br><br>
  				In June 1997, the group is reduced to fifty musicians for a two hour concert with the music he composed for films. 
			    And it's one success after another. He undertakes a triumphal tour throughout 
			    Europe with his Wedding and Funeral Band presenting live his most beautiful 
			    pieces from the famous &quot; Ederlezi&quot; (Time of the Gypsies) to the 
			    &quot; In the Death Car&quot; (Arizona Dream) and the energetic &quot;Kalasnikov&quot; 
			    (Underground) taking off as delirious audience echoes the with the powerful 
			    &quot;Juris&quot; (Charge ! !). The number of entries - between 3,500 and 
			    10,000 per concert - and the concert given May 1st at the Piazza St. Giovanni 
			    in Rome in front of 500.000 people confirm that his music now has a real impact 
			    on an international level.<br><br>
			  	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goran BREGOVIC continues his career, 
    			and the young local rock star of the 70s and the 80s asserts his authority 
    			as a mature, successful, international composer.<br></p>
				
			  	<p align=center>Musical Collaborations</p>
  				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a happy grown up child, Goran is amazed to be collaborating with such important performers from diverse 
			    cultures - people he would have asked for an autograph not so long ago : Iggy 
			    Pop, whom he totally reinvents (Arizona Dream 1993), Ofra Haza (La Reine Margot,1994), 
			    Césaria Evora (Underground 1995), Scot WALKER in UK, Setzen Aksu in 
			    Turkey, George Dalaras in Greece, Kayah in Poland..</font></p>

				<p align=center><b>Special Projects</b></p>
			  	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giovanni FERETTI of the legendary 
			    italian group CSI, art director of &quot; Bolongna 2000 &quot;, asked Goran 
			    BREGOVIC to be the ambassador of music from the orthodox countries for a night-long 
			    fiesta on June 27. Goran called it &quot;Hot Balkan Roots&quot; and invited 
			    three brass bands (one from Bulgaria, one from Rumania and another one from 
			    Serbia) and a group of Russian female voices. A joint concert of BREGOVIC 
			    and CSI topped it all and the party was repeated on June 29 at the prestigious 
			    NUOVO AUDITORIUM DI ROMA.<br><br>
			 	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To start off his Italian tour in 
			    Summer 2000, Goran concocted a &quot;Big Wedding in Palermo&quot; for the 
			    Santa Rosalia Celebration on July 14, for which he shared artistic direction 
			    with the famous musicologist and composer from Naples, Roberto de SIMONE. 
			    For just one very special night, Goran a assembled artists from countries 
			    that he calls his &quot; musical feeding-ground &quot; - between Budapest 
			    and Istanbul. To Goran's music and to images of video director from Belgrade, 
			    Boris MILJKOVIC, Slovenian and Greek dancers danced under direction of a gifted 
			    Rumanian choreographer , Edward CLUG. And once again he called on the brass 
			    bands (a wedding with no brass band is no wedding) to lead 80 brides and bridegrooms 
			    each from opposite parts of the beautiful town of Palermo to the central square 
			    where, around three in the morning, they met with Clug's professional dancers 
			    and Goran's Weddings and Funerals Band for a long final wedding dance.<br><br>
			  	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 2002, Goran BREGOVIC united 
			    three star singers from three religions with the Moscow orthodox choir, a 
			    string section from Tetouan in Morocco, and his Weddings and Funerals Orchestra, 
			    for a special project called &quot;Tolerant Heart&quot; on the theme of reconciliation 
			    in the St. Denis Basilica (near Paris). Lucciano Berio invited the same project 
			    to his Accademia di Santa Cecilia in Rome in July, a concert in the Milan 
			    Duomo is planned… and it can be said that another side of &quot;contemporary 
			    music&quot; composer has been added to Goran's career.</p>
				
				<p align=center><b>And Nowadays</b></p>
			  	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After tours across Europe and South 
			    America during the whole of 2002 and four triumphant concerts in Paris in 
			    November (two in the underground &quot;Bataclan&quot; and two in the temple 
			    of classical music &quot;Théâtre des Champs Elysées&quot;), 
			    Goran starts work on his new project: &quot;Bregovic's Carmen with a Happy 
			    End&quot;, the first Carmen with a Balkan accent. The piece will be a combination 
			    of fake documentary film (collaboration with a wonderful film director, Milos 
			    RADOVIC) and naïve theatre with live music - of course - and will be 
			    premiered in Italy in March 2003.<br><br>
			  	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Carmen&quot; tours in the 
			    Spring, concerts in Scandinavia, France, Rumania, Spain, a rendering of &quot;Tolerant 
			    Heart&quot; at the Festival of Sacred Music in Fez, Morocco in June, then 
			    Summer Festivals across Europe… gypsy life continues for this eclectic composer 
			    figure.</p>
