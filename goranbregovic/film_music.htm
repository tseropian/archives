				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming from the same background, the same generation, survivors of the same experiences, Goran BREGOVIC 
				and Emir KUSTURICA formed a tandem which didn't need words to communicate.  After "Times of the Gypsies" Goran had a free hand to 
				compose the original soundtrack for "Arizona Dream".  The music lives up to the film - poetical, original and incredibly enhancing.  
				"One of the great things about Emir's movies is that they show life exactly as it is - full of holes, hesitations and unexpected events. 
				It's this imperfect, unorganised side that I wanted to preserve above all.<br>
				<br>
			    Even the songs recorded with Iggy are very under-produced.  There's just his voice and behind it a gypsy-orchestra blowing into old 
				pre-war trumpets and cow's horns.  It's really very simple."  What Goran doesn't say is that it's probably one of Iggy's best 
				performances over the past ten years.  What he doesn't say either is that this apparent simplicity belongs only to artists of 
				exceptional talent.<br>
				<br>
			    Patrice CHEREAU entrusts him with the music for "La Reine Margot", Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 1994. 
				Goran delivers a majestic piece with rock accents. The music for Emir KUSTURICA's  "Underground", Palme d'Or at the 1995 
				Cannes Film Festival, was also signed by Goran.  But not the following film.  A three year collaboration on 
				"Underground" has worn everyone out and Emir has to find a whole new team for his next film "White Cat Black Cat".<br>
				<br>
    			Recently Goran composed spicy music with a "kletzmer" aroma for the  "Train de Vie" of Radu MIHAELANU acclaimed by the 
				critics in Venice, Sao Paulo, Berlin and by the public everywhere it was shown.<br>
				<br>
			    He has since devoted himself to the interpretation of his own music and lent himself to a second stage-career.</font></p>				
				
  				<p align=center><b>On Goran BREGOVIC's music (sleeve of "Music for Films")</b></p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing less easy to introduce, and less civilized than Goran Bregovic's fundamentally unpure art. 
				Just a few bars filled with joyfull melancholy, and here you are, shaken to the guts by a sound without equal; irreparably embarked 
				in the wild farandole of a colossal and mad brass band with a delightfully tormented orchestration, from which suddenly arise, 
				like coming from another age, the angelical purity of a kid's voice; buttonholed by the baroque and poetic melting pot of a music 
				alive to excess, both modern and archaic, illuminated by an intense grace under its underpolished appearances, commited in a crazy 
				and rattling race, with this festive lightness in the pace, this unsound rhythm, both grave and volte-facing, constantly off unbalance, 
				that finally leads you straight to the graveyard....<br>
				<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Bregovic's music charm resides precisely in this very strictly organized inextricable mess, in this 
				learnedly orchestrated emotional uncertainty - this mad laugh that chokes on itself, this unfathomable despair that is exorcizing 
				itself into a bacchanalia.<br>
				<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of a sudden, we are thrusted into the heart of the Balkan's genius, into this sweet and irresistible 
				confusion of feelings, where people are, at the same time, laughing, crying and singing, between an ironic thoughtlessness and an 
				exacerbated sentimentalism - life there is a permanent and opencast complete theater, with its intense dramas, its unutterable joys and, 
				always, omnipresent, this beautiful nostalgia that never overloades itself, like by some kind of magic, in one inexhaustible fountain 
				of life.....<br>
				<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, a luxurious overflowing music, dramatic and cajoling, with a juvenile and slightly crafty charm, 
				never avoiding any trick to touch people's hearts and seduce the senses, implementing a gigantic heterogeneousness of tools and 
				techniques to reach its goals, with, at the end, this little something so odd in the art of detail that never excludes a general 
				feeling of overall undisputable aesthetic, somewhere between recycled "art brut" and an indubitable pop kitsch diversion.<br>
				<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's precisely where Bregovic's haphazardous music definitely asserts its extraordinary topicality - 
				in this very direct and truly popular way of deriving from our overconsumming society's garbage, enough to feed our hunger of emotions, 
				our irresistible life wish, claiming for itself the official shapes and speeches in order to, in a mischievously naïve gesture, 
				allied to a great spontaneity of intention and a rather sarcastic sense of humour, misappropriate, subverte and, finally, reinvent 
				and reestablish them in their lost innocence.....  This basically post-modern position is neither an opportunist attitude, nor an easy 
				compromising to the in thing: this disillusion (which is all but despaired !!!) about the way the world is going, drifting or raving, 
				Bregovic has forever been experiencing in his own flesh....<br> 
				<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born almost half a century ago from a Serbian mother and a Croatian father, he was an idolized rock star in 
				Tito's Yugoslavia with his band Bjelo Dugme before gaining international recognition at the turn of the '90s, writing back to back 
				three major scores for movie director Emir Kusturica.<br>
				<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While his country was starting a fratricidal war - Bregovic seems to have crossed in a state of awaken bad 
				dream all the period's backwashes: the ideologies' fair, the mascarades and tragedies of history, from communist horror to nationalist 
				hysteria, through the overall false pretence of Western world humanism....  Which probably explains this deep feeling of dealing with a 
				music that has truly lost all of its illusions, ideologically as well as aesthetically, finally drawing its inspiration and its 
				originality from a concerted back to the roots move, recrossing the Balkans, the amazing ethnic and cultural puzzle of their territories 
				moulded as well as devastated by hundred years of political conflicts, in order to gather the humanity abandonned there by major 
				political systems and reinstall it in the heart of our time.....<br>
				<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is finally by choosing to consider the whole complexity of his country, like a kind of huge laboratory for the major problematics of 
				our decaying/resetting world, by deciding to honestly accounting it without wanting to resolve its conflicts and other contradictions 
				that Bregovic, in this blazing and delightfully kitsch baroque, the way he plays around supposedly minor musical styles, this faculty 
				to catch the vitality of the sub-culture in its most trashy aspects, definitively excluded from the tasteful spheres, is resisting in 
				his own very personal way to the scheduled standardization of taste and feelings and to the control of conscience, those new threats of 
				our "globalized" world.....<br>
				<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all is said and done, it's because he is considering himself today as totally and consciously Yougoslavian that Goran Bregovic is 
				such a universal composer.</font></p>
