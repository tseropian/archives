				<center><b>BREGOVIC IN ALL HIS SPLENDOR</b></center>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little by little, with no unnecessary haste, with that blessed calm that illuminates solid success far from superficial media fireworks, the original music of Goran Bregovic has gained a real following in our country. For the past four years he has attracted the sensibility of most varied audiences in Europe letting them taste something that started out as original film-track music, and that ends up anchored in our orphic subconscious as the most beautiful, captivating, cross-breed visual symphony that has been woven over this last decade of the XX century. It is a mind-blowing return trip with no destination or port of arrival.<br>
				<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, the Spanish music-lovers, have joined the pied-piper procession of this Yugoslav (in heart and soul), in July 1998 during the sinuous dance of the "Pyrénées Sud" Festival. His unquestionable power of attraction has been proven by this second passage in Barcelona where a crowd followed his stage epiphany in Palau de la Musica, nudged by "Kalasnikov", letting its spirit dance an "Underground Tango" with "Queen Margot" to relieve the "Ausencia" of "Time of the Gypsies"
				(translator's note: all these are titles of either songs or films for which Bregovic wrote music).<br>
				<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The painstaking travels of this Ulysses of the ear-ocean was generously rewarded. For Goran (according to his own words) the reward was to perform in this most beautiful of concert halls. For those of us who appreciate the hypnotic power of his music, it was to finally hear it under best possible conditions and to be able not only to profit from the contents and the whole, but also from the form in its most minute details, happy to see Bregovic and his inseparable alter-ego, the hyper-filmic Ognjan Radivojevic, faces lit up with joy.<br>
				<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alongside the author and musical director of this "invention" we find forty musicians of different formations: string orchestra, a male choir, a trio of Bulgarian voices and the ear-blowing brass of the Funeral and Wedding band who, lure us with magnetic force into Bregovic's complex universe. A magnificent concert, one of the greatest marvels to be heard on stage today.<br>
				<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Balkan Soul offers us not only reasons for fear and weariness as in their latest belligerent exploits. From the mud appear also flowers of incomparable splendour and beauty. Kusturica has made us see them. Bregovic has made us hear them. Together or individually, they bequeath for the artistic archives of the Volcano of Europe the most vivifying lava that one can imagine. May gods and muses of art replace devils of war and disaster. So be it.<br>

				<center><b>GORAN BREGOVIC - SYNTHESIS OF THE BALKANS</b></center><br>
				Place:<b>Madrid</b> "Congress Hall"<br>
				<br>
				Performers: Goran Bregovic (voice, electric guitar), Ognjan Radivojevic (percussions, accordion, voice, musical direction), Soloists of the Philip Koutev Ensemble (voices), Polish string orchestra, Belgrade Choir, Wedding and Funeral Band.<br>
				<br>
				Date: April 23 2001.<br>
				<br>
				- If it weren't for his striving towards a folly of disparate sound and his pretentiously pompous taste, we could consider that the place of the Yugoslav Goran Bregovic's music is in the European, and even World avant-garde.<br>
				<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His capacity to synthesize all musical cultures of the Balkans and to pep them up with that particular nuance that renders them contemporary, and his inborn sense for internal rhythm of sequences on stage, make his concert one of the most risky, devastating and attractive events going.<br>
				<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not so long ago he was known for original music tracks for the famous films of his compatriot Emir Kusturica ("Times of the Gypsies", "Underground"). But soon we learned that within the shy soul of Goran Bregovic hides a rocker spirit, inspired by old quintessence of the 'genre', refurbished by post-punk rebellion.<br>
				<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such artistic ingredients, plus a great passion for his home-land, it's traditional music and contemporary tragedies, Goran has construed a unique and inimitable musical structure endowed with virtues and excesses inherent to that existential conglomerate.<br>
				<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious and sublime echo of the three Bulgarian voices, the opaqueness and density of the powerful male choir from Belgrade (15 voices) and a large array of string instruments are overshadowed by what Bregovic calls his "Wedding and Funeral Orchestra", seven gypsies who blow their brass instruments with an irresistible drive.<br>
				<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of them, the master of ceremonies, Radivojevic, beats pitilessly his percussions reminding us of a Japanese Kodo master. Next to him, Goran Bregovic, the feverish imagination that has conceived this futuristic universe, sits attentive, innocent-looking, as if he never broke a plate in his life. Geniuses are like that.<br>

				<center><b>OLÉ, GORAN !!!</b></center><br>
				<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goran Bregovic, Wedding and Funeral Band , String Orchestra from Poland, three Bulgarian voices and the Male Choir from Belgrade. The Congress Hall, Madrid April 23 2001.<br>
				<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most beautiful symphonies of the Old Europe. Polish violins and violas weave a musical canvas on which a clarinet from the Balkans draws arabesques that incite our feet to set off dancing a Central-European tango. Over the strings, three female Bulgarian voices break the bomb-like thumping of a gentleman in black resembling a Mongolian worrier. It's Ognjan Radivojevic who gets up to conduct the solemn Serbian Male Choir. Stage left enter seven gypsies of the Wedding and Funeral Band who madly blow into their brass instruments, while stage right, discretely appears Goran Bregovic, in a white linen suit.<br>
				<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these disparate and apparently contradictory elements, Bregovic, who relentlessly observes his companions (40 on stage) with an expression that varies from amazement to bemusement, creates the most breath-taking music on this continent. Music that deals with two transcendent issues: love and death.<br>
				<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His art is exciting tight-rope walking - it does not abide by media strategies or conjectural interests - it stretches between classicism and Balkan square-dance, the contemporary and the popular, sacred music à la Pärt or Gorecki and the rowdy gypsy brass band. He sets off from the tradition without falling into the trap of traditional music. Almost three hours of music - intense, vigorous, colourful, passionate, exotic, fascinating.<br>

				<center><b>Goran Bregovic : MORAL AND SHIVERS</b></center>
				Place: MADRID Congres Hall.<br>
				<br>
				Date : April 23.<br>
				<br>
				The fashion of reviving all sorts of popular music in most spectacular manners has recently set its heart on musical world of the Gypsies. It's been sixty years since the Belgian guitarist Django Reihhard conducted, for the first time, an orchestra, becoming thus the greatest reviver of Gypsy music. Today a number of names join him in this enterprise, but no one does it with the intelligence of the Yugoslav Goran Bregovic. The result of his inventions resembles no other. He is light years from them, both by means but even more by his ingenuity.<br>
				<br>
				You will probably remember that Bregovic has already stormed through our theatres two years ago. He was accompanied by four entities who interpreted his music originally made for films, his compositions for the rock group Bijelo Dugme, and his symphonic ideas that had no other aim but to be recorded. This Spanish tour keeps the same interpreters, but the repertoire reveals new pieces, flashes of his new album.<br>
				<br>
				Three female voices from the Bulgarian choir "Philip Koutev", thirteen masters of the Polish String Orchestra, fifteen singers of the Belgrade choir and a brass septet (known as The Wedding and Funeral Orchestra) are in the service of a permanent contrast between the most advanced technology of musical construction and a pinch of folkloric perfumes from the Balkans. Bregovic does not forget to add to this vast sound melting pot the attraction of several Rock and Roll pieces, conveniently tinted with powerful traditional inspiration.<br>
				<br>
				During a three-hour spectacle, Goran Bregovic excels in singing, acoustic and electric guitar, synthesisers and percussions. With the complicity of a capital character in this project, the conductor Ognjan Raidvojevic, adding percussions, accordion to his multiple talents.<br>
				<br>
				TV documents cannot convey the emotions that these people awake, because they only show the appearance. The colour of difference between identities of these peoples cannot be felt on TV. But Goran Bregovic has managed to bring to us, in several buses, a big bunch of live images, that - like some gigantic powder-keg, provided us with an X-ray image of the cynical Europe that we all inhabit.<br>
