  <a name=storm><b>Storm</b></a><br>
  If you wanted to,<br>
  ...say you wanted to...<br>
  If you wanted to save the world<br>
  Where could you start? How could you start?<br>
  If you wanted to feel like I feel<br>
  ...like I feel<br>
  You're running dry...<br>
  ...I'm flying high<br>
  We're running on feel<br>
  You wanted to be, what you've never been before<br>
  We worked hard for a living<br>
  We worked hard for it all<br>
  You run and hide,<br>
  ...don't run and hide<br>
  I'm starting to feel OK<br>
  But I'm wasted<br>
  And I'm failing<br>
  Oh Tracy please<br>
  Can't you see?<br>
  It's just me<br>
  I wanted to feel<br>
  What I've never felt before<br>
  I was tired of the living<br>
  I was tired of it all<br>
  Time, time<br>
  ...it's only...time.<br>
  If we wanted to,<br>
  ...say we wanted to...<br>
  If we wanted to save our world<br>
  I'm waiting here, waiting<br>
  Waiting here baby please...<br>
  STAY WITH ME<br>
  We wanted to be<br>
  What we've never been before<br>
  But are we tired of the living?<br>
  ...Are we tired of the war?<br>
<br><a name=ra><b>Random Analysis</b></a><br>
  Analyze the compromise<br>
  Career is why I think or say the things I do<br>
  Relationship in honesty, so here's a little story for you;<br>
  Met a girl, I met a girl at random,<br>
  Random is as random does<br>
  Justify don't ask me why...why?<br>
  Just because.<br>
  I'm acting like a day old male<br>
  Day old female<br>
  Saturday, another day, and life's a little give and take<br>
  Take and give<br>
  I'm staying home, I'm sorry boys I'm a little sensitive<br>
  But still you're saying;<br>
  'Faggot is as faggot does with every little faggot thing a faggot do'<br>
  I'm not insane, I'm not insane...I'm just smarter than you.<br>
  You're acting like a day old male<br>
  Day old female<br>
  Analyze, Compromise.<br>
  WHY???<br>
  But I'm loving<br>
  ...And insecure<br>
  ...And just a little bit violent<br>
  But I know for sure,<br>
  I'm here for your entertainment<br>
  I'm here, for your unbridled entertainment<br>
  So lets go.<br>
  Far away, in Fantasy<br>
  Don't get me wrong I like it too and feel it too<br>
  But understand that man or woman, I don't want to sleep with you.<br>
  'Cause power is as power does<br>
  With every little power trip we pull because;<br>
  It's all inside our selfish pride wanting the control of it all<br>
  (controlling it all! CONTROL EMOTION!!!)<br>
  Day old male<br>
  Day old female;<br>
  Analyze.<br>
  Compromise. (compromise baby...)<br>
  WHY???<br>
<br><br>
  <a name=dh><b>Deadhead</b></a><br>
  You are a sun Goddess<br>
  Will you save me?<br>
  Hooray for you.<br>
  Hooray.<br>
  Now the rain it comes, the rain it blurs the grey line<br>
  ...the grey line...the Greyhound home<br>
  You are so vicious (Hurt me, I can take it)<br>
  Cause it's all in the heat of the moment,<br>
  It's all in the pain<br>
  Sonar, sonar again...<br>
  It's on again, (got no wings...gossamer wings...) ...on again...<br>
  You are a sun Goddess!!!<br>
  Will you save me? ...babe...babe...babe...<br>
  Cause it's all in the heat of the moment<br>
  It's all in the pain!!!<br>
  So give in to the heat of the moment<br>
  Give in to the pain!!!<br>

  <a name=suicide><b>Suicide</b></a><br>
  Three hour suicide<br>
  ...To get me out of here<br>
  In three years, 'Deicide' is all I'll ever hear.<br>
  Death of God<br>
  ...Death of feeling anything at all<br>
  All my life this is understood<br>
  Wasting my time like you knew that I would...knew that I would<br>

  All my pride just to keep it inside...keep it INSIDE<br>
  Ten thousand lies...<br>
  TEN THOUSAND LIES!!!<br>

  <a name=trav><b>Traveller</b></a><br>
  The life I have<br>
  Is the life I've always wanted<br>
  and there's no more feeling low...<br>
  Early morning, and I'm on the go!<br>
  Here I'm finally on the road...<br>
  On the road!<br>
  And I wanna put my faith in you babe<br>
  But I have to face it in another way<br>
  Let go...free from all<br>

  <a name=away><b>Away</b></a><br>
  (I'm an idiot.)<br>
  Well stop being an idiot then!!!<br>
  Even though I've made a few new friends...<br>
  It's hard to be back here in Sweden again<br>
  As above and so below my friend<br>
  It's hard to be back here in Sweden again<br>
  ...?<br>
<br><br>
  <a name=sa><b>Sunday Afternoon</b></a><br>
  Dream on<br>
  (Dream on, dream on...)<br>
  Dream another way<br>
  'cause I know<br>
  (I know, I know...)<br>
  When the wind blows your name<br>
  ...It's a shame...<br>
  Things are strange but that's OK<br>
  On a rainy Sunday afternoon...<br>
  In your place<br>
  In our place<br>
  In the swarm<br>
  So from the great plains<br>
  ...From the void...<br>
  I will wait for you<br>
  I!<br>
  I will wait for you...<br>
  I will!!<br>
  I will wait for you<br>
  I will wait alone.<br>
  Ain't it strange?<br>
  People change but that's OK<br>
  It's another night here, and all I'm thinking about is you.<br>
  In your place<br>
  In our place<br>
  In the swarm<br>
  So from the great plains<br>
  ...From the void...<br>
  Yeah, from the deep field<br>
  ...From the void...<br>
  I will wait for you...<br>
  I!<br>
  I will wait for you...<br>
  I will!!<br>
  I will wait for you<br>

<br>
  <a name=smd><b>Slow Me Down</b></a><br>
  It's so easy when you call<br>
  I was waiting by the phone<br>
  Knowing that you're all alone<br>
  And I ask you when you call;<br>
  'But will you wait for me?'<br>
  ...Will you wait for me?<br>
  Cause in a while I'll never look behind<br>
  Even when I'll nearly lose my mind<br>
  So when the devil wins that toss<br>
  Will we be making it across?<br>
  Hang on...<br>
  Want it ,need it,<br>
  My want is found and feeding,<br>
  Hanging around with a girl<br>
  'Cause I want it, need it,<br>
  So bad I can hardly breathe but it slows me down.<br>
  And through all we bear the scars,<br>
  on the soul, through the stars,<br>
  Alone...<br>
  Forever we roam.<br>
  And you ask me when you call;<br>
  'But will you wait for me?'<br>
  ...I will wait for you!<br>
  Cause in a while I'll never look behind<br>
  Even when I'll nearly lose my mind<br>
  So when the devil wins that toss<br>
  Will they be making it a cross?<br>
  Hang on...<br>
  Want it ,need it,<br>
  My want is found and feeding,<br>
  Hanging around with a girl<br>
  'Cause I want it, need it,<br>
  So bad I can hardly breathe but it slows me down.<br>
  Feel it in my mind and soul<br>
  Feel it in my constant lies<br>
  Feel it now, feel it go away... OH YEAH!<br>
  I WANNA GO, WHERE NOBODY'S GONE<br>
  WHILE HANGING AROUND WITH THAT GIRL<br>
  'CAUSE NOBODY KNOWS WHERE THE RIVER FLOWS NOW...<br>
  YOU'VE SLOWED ME DOWN!!!<br>
