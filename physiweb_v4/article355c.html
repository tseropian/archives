Sunday Evening Interview<br><br><a href="presse9f3e.html?l=1"><b>Retour � la section presse</b></a><br><br><b>My first question is about your touring, because in the U.S you’re going to tour with Meshuggah, do you enjoy their stuff and how did you meet them ?</b>
<br>
I really enjoy Meshuggah’s music, I had never met before, I just talked once to their guitar player at one show but I’m looking forward to tour with them and I hope we’ll get along.
<br>
<br>
<b>Apart from the touring, what are your projects with the Devin Townsend Band and Strapping Young lad ?</b>
<br>
I’ve been working with the Devin Townsend band and Strapping Young lad for over two years and now I’m gonna try to do some different stuff like production, different avenues, but with some time I’ll look forward to do a new album, lot of touring, more records, live videos I guess, you know a lot of stuff.
<br>
<br>
<b>Live videos ?</b>
<br>
Yeah.
<br>
<br>
<b>The last SYL album was the first one to be composed with the whole band, and not just you writing the songs ...</b>
<br>
That’s true !
<br>
<br>
<b>... wasn’t it sometimes frustrating to withdraw from the composition to let the other members express themselves ?</b>
<br>
Well ... no ! I mean I’m still pretty much the primary writer and so a lot of the time the idea from me remains and it’s just about make it better so it’s like “if that can be better, that’s great”.
<br>
<br>
<b>Ok, but because of the composition process, you said your true new album was “Accelerated Evolution”, aren’t you bothered by the fact that SYL is given much more media coverage ?</b>
<br>
Mmm no I guess ... I have faith that in the future, the Devin Townsend’s band will be given has much coverage.
<br>
<br>
<b>Sure ... about the SYL lyrics : I heard that the Rape song was written after your watching the Gaspard Noe’s movie “Irreversible” ?</b>
<br>
Yeah .. mmm no, well, I don’t know what it was ... ok obviously it’s an anti-rape song, but I don’t know I was depressed, to see rape on TV ...
<br>
<br>
<b>“Accelerated Evolution” contains melodic songs, have you intentionally written more radiophonic songs ?</b>
<br>
Yeah but not with the intention to get on the radio, because they’ll never get on the radio ... I love that type of music, right ... I like melodic hard rock as much as I like trash metal and black metal , I really like melodic music, just because sometimes it’s not cool shouldn’t be a reason not to do it.
<br>
<br>
<b>Ok, so “no limit” ...</b>
<br>
No limit.
<br>
<br>
<b>By the way, about black metal, I heard you was a great fan of that type of music, what are you links with the scene ?</b>
<br>
I don’t really have a link with this scene, I mean I know a few people, the guys from Emperor,  I really exalt  Mayhem the record “Deathcrush” (???)was very good so it’s like favorite any type of music you know which come from the heart, for the black metal you know what I mean : it’s just powerful music, there’s some cool power in black metal.
<br>
<br>
<b>About the lyrics of “Accelerated Evolution” and the love topic, because the song “Storm” is explicitly intended to Tracy, so weren’t you maybe nervous before making her listen to the “Accelerated Evolution” songs ?</b>
<br>
Sure ! nervous nervous ! but I guess it’s right, I can’t hide from it -  you know what I mean – it’s like, you know ... artists involve expressing emotions you know, and the best way for me to rid of my emotions is to sing about things I know, and that’s my life you know, Tracy is part of my life, so is Strapping, so is my family and a lot of things, I mean it’s just honest to sing about it.</b>
<br>
<b>At the same time, the rest of the lyrics are vague, is it voluntary done to make as much people as possible relate to them ?</b>
<br>
I think so, I mean when I’m writing my lyrics unconsciously every time I guess it’s too personal, like not personal but too ... “just me”, I always change it . Writing is like watching somebody, perhaps it’s me, but that’d be too much because I think when people listen to music, they’re “ok that’s so like me” or “I think that” or “that happened to me” and with “Accelerated Evolution” a lot of what I’m saying is about relationship between people who live emotional relationship and ninety per cent of the world deal with relationship of some sort, so I think it’s only reasonable, when I write my lyrics to make them as universal as I can.
<br>
<br>
<b>Ok, so vague lyrics so that people may have their personal interpretation ?</b>
<br>
Yes because the music doesn’t have to be interpreted and the songs can be about anything. But when it comes to the lyrics : if you meet somebody new for the first time, or you’re waiting somebody who’s away from you, certain songs which are on the record if you have a listen to, that’s it, because it’s not about anything you know, like the song “Sunday afternoon” it’s not like Sunday April 15th 1999, it’s just about your working for example, and you have Saturday and Sunday off. Sunday afternoon is a very special feeling, it’s like bittersweet but that’s energy is not about Sunday afternoon, Sunday afternoon is a metaphor, a metaphor for that feeling, that bittersweet feeling that can apply to a lot of things you know, like in an emotional relationship with somebody, that feeling is there a lot, it will hurt in a way, but that pain is also ... it’s pain still, but the kind of pain you draw pictures about, write songs about, or write letters to get rid of it or whatever, and to me the idea of making music is capturing those emotions, that type of emotions.
<br>
<br>
<b>Do you think the Devin Townsend band will become a more democratic project or not ?</b>
<br>
I don’t think the writing will.<br><br>Elodie & Thoomis<br><br><a href="presse9f3e.html?l=1"><b>Retour � la section presse</b></a>
