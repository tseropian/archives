<a name=mount><b>Mountain</b></a><br>
Nerves on fire, nothing is a sneaker...everything is catastrophe<br>
  That bump in your armpit is Cancer<br>
  That bump was turbulence<br>
  I guess it starts again<br>
<br>  
There is no reason for nostalgia,<br>
  Everything is still happening,<br>
  There is no reason for memory<br>
  <br>
The step, a choice.<br>
  I wish everything could have worked out the way you wanted it to<br>
  It's so tragic...so beautiful...<br>
  When everything is so hollow<br>
  Think of going home.<br>
<br>
You are so beautiful to me<br>
  You are so beautiful to me<br>
  So far, i've logged so many hours<br>
  With medications and the dog<br>
  ...You are so beautiful to me<br>
<br>  
So far, I've lost so many hours,<br>
  Two medications and a dog<br>
<br>  
IT'S JUST ANOTHER MOUNTAIN!<br>
  ...JUST ANOTHER MOUNTAIN!<br>
Just another weakness<br>

Eat your beets, recycle...recycle...<br>
  Don't eat your beets, recycle...recycle<br>
<br>  
The message is; 'THERE IS NO MESSAGE'<br>
<br>
Babe, you better not ever think,<br>
  Staring into the drink...get out of my mind...<br>
  Cause I may not be the one to say,<br>
  is there no other way we could do this another day?<br>
<br>  
I saw God.<br>
<br>
She said...'If you don't believe me, guaranteed you'll never leave me'<br>
  On your way, and out of my time<br>
  But I didn't even know if it was true or just a result of chemicals<br>
<br>
Shut up and think of something more important to say...<br>
  'Sometimes I think that in every straight there's a gay!' Something or nothing 
  a whole either way it's a way,<br>
  it's a way, it's a way, it's a way, it's a way<br>
  EARTH DAY, EARTH DAY, EARTH DAY, EARTH DAY<br>
  it's a way, it's a way, it's a way, it's a way<br>
  EARTH DAY, EARTH DAY, EARTH DAY, EARTH DAY<br>
<br>
It's like your birthday, it's on Earth Day,<br>
  Like a child you're born again, little child you're bored again...<br>
  It's your worst fucking day, it's on Earth Day...<br>
  Little lies to cover up...please make your mind up<br>
<br>
(Eat your beets, Recycle...recycle...)<br>
  (...Don't eat your beets, recycle...recycle)<br>
<br>
Man Overboard (I'm so far away)<br>
  Man overboard (I'm so far...)<br>
  But fuck it! ...I really don't care<br>
  Fuck! Listen to me! Just shut the fuck up!<br>
<br>
Peace, Love, Joy<br>
  Man overboard (I'm so far...)<br>
  Hate, hell, war<br>
  Hate, love, love, hate, love, hate...destruction!<br>
  <br>
So just shut your face and take a seat<br>
  Because after all, you're just talking meat...and music?<br>
  Well, it's just entertainment folks.<br>
  <br>
Sometimes I think that I really have something moreto say...<br>
  'Sometimes I think that in every straight there's a gay!' ...forgive me for 
  saying it blows either way, it's a way,<br>
  it's a way, it's a way, it's a way, it's a way...<br>
  <br>
It's your birthday, it's on Earth Day,<br>
  Like a child you're born again, little child you're cold again...<br>
  It's your worst fucking day, it's on Earth Day<br>
  Little child your time is up...please turn the heat up<br>
  <br>
You need your beets, you recycle...<br>

It's alright to cry<br>
  It's alright to lean on everyone<br>
  It's alright to lie in the bed you've made for everyone<br>
  
And anytime you need someone,<br>
  Anytime you heed someone<br>
  Anytime you need me babe, I will be there.<br>
  <br>
It's alright to die<br>
  It's alright to bleed on everyone<br>
  It's alright this time<br>
  It's all life, you learn from everyone<br>
  <br>
With every single time you go<br>
  ...And every single line you blow<br>
  Anytime you need it man, I won't be there<br>
(inside the picture of the huge, sterile balck and white diner on a rainy Sunday 
  afternoon in chinatown)<br>
  <br>
It's all going away now<br>
  ...All going away now<br>
  Going, going...gone<br>
  Going, going...gone<br>
  <br>
It's alright to cry<br>
  It's alright to feed on everyone<br>
  It's alright to hide,<br>
  In your cozy bed from everyone<br>
  <br>
So anytime you need it man,<br>
  Get inside and be it man...<br>
  Anytime you call,<br>
  Suffer!!!<br>

The road,<br>
  It's home,<br>
  At least for now, the rivers low<br>
  <br>
Wake me, please wake me,<br>
  It's cold and warm on the prairie freeway<br>
  <br>
All the time I needed your approval to be me<br>
  All that time spent waiting for the jury duty...<br>
  More than ever I needed Mora<br>
  More than Mora means...<br>
  Be whatever you must be to get by<br>
  <br>
It's oil, It's wheat, It's soil, It's meat<br>
  It's beef!<br>
  <br>
The road, it's home, the mountain high, river low...<br>
  Wake me, please wake me,<br>
  When it's my turn to drive<br>
  Only the lonely (and maybe John Denver) know the Canadian freeway.<br>

  <br>
I am a Fluke in the world<br>
  I haven't spoken a single word<br>
  I'll have to wade through the bullshit<br>
  Baby just to find my own vision of pearl<br>
  I am a fluke in your world<br>
  And even tho it's a bit absurd<br>
  I've been living in a dreamworld man<br>
  And I hope you'll enjoy what I've heard<br>
  <br>
Can't you see through me?<br>
  Can't you hear through me?<br>
  Just a moment in time...<br>
  <br>
FREAK!!! ...FLUKE!!!<br>
<br>
Down and under I've felt the toll<br>
  You can't hurt me any more<br>
  <br>
I'm not afraid of you anymore!<br>
<br>
Can't you see through me?<br>
  Can't you hear through me?<br>
  ...Corona without a lime.<br>

BREAK LYRICS :<br>
Writing and eating and shitting and sleeping<br>
  in rain or in shine masturbate til I'm blind.<br>
  In the cause and effect of the one troubled segment<br>
  of time and the place and the look on your face.<br>
  <br>
And I write and I eat and I shit and I sleep<br>
  yes, I eat leafy greens nearly three times a week.<br>
  And I'm not unafraid but no longer afraid of you<br>
  anymore.<br>

<a name=nh><b>Nobody's Here</b></a><br>
  <br>
Hello, it's good to see you here<br>
  Come in, can I offer you a beer?<br>
  And they say this what it's like forever<br>
  ...Roll this up, it's deadly...<br>
  To feel, feel like there's nobody here<br>
  ...Feel like there's no more fear<br>
  I wanna feel like this for a year...<br>
  ...Feel like there's nobody here...<br>
  <br>
Why can't I remember?<br>
<br>
Heroes, they take my breath away<br>
  Zero the dials<br>
  See how a breakdown breaks ground<br>
  And zeros the miles<br>

  <a name=tt><b>Tiny Tears</b></a><br>
Baby baby, don't you cry<br>
  Wipe away that tear from your eye<br>
  Sailing on a sea of blue<br>
  In my dreams theres a place for me and you<br>
  <br>
Baby babe don't say a word<br>
  In this life you get all that you deserve<br>
  I'm sorry that I made you cry<br>
  I can't believe that I'm just an ordinary guy<br>
  <br>
When all is said and done<br>
  It's all only won by one<br>
  <br>
And now i'm 29 years old<br>
  And i'm a million miles away<br>
Hey babe, don't treat it like it's a fucking luxury.<br>
<br>
Baby babe, don't say a word<br>
  In this life you get all that you deserve<br>
  I'm sorry that I made you cry<br>
  I can't believe that I'm just an ordinary guy<br>
  <br>
I can't believe I made you cry<br>
  I can't believe that made you cry<br>
  I can't believe this makes you cry<br>
  <br>
I see you<br>
  I need you<br>
  I leave you behind<br>
  I've learned my lesson<br>
  <br>
O.K I'm bored now.<br>

  <a name=st><b>Stagnant</b></a><br>
Summer's here, the sunlight greets the day<br>
  The winters gone, there's no more rain today...<br>
  And if I could, I'm sure that I would take your breath away<br>
  So ain't it funny how, after trying to find my way home<br>
  I'm in the middle now and I won't get lost again<br>
<br>
Cause in the winter time, when everything is grey<br>
  And in the summer time, into the month of May<br>
  I get a feeling that it's all so temporary<br>
  And that's the feeling that can take my blues away<br>
<br>
Tired of the way that I'm feeling everyday<br>
  And I feel it in my head...woo-hoo-hoo...<br>
  Tired of the way that I'm feeling everyday<br>
  And I feel it in my head now, my head now<br>
<br>
It's beautiful, the way it's meant to be...beautiful, but it 'don't do shit' 
  for me...<br>
  So peel away a little skin and choke upon the bone<br>
  And ain't it funny how, after trying to find my way home,<br>
  I'm in the middle now, and I won't get lost again.<br>
<br>
But you don't know, how or when it's gonna go<br>
<br>
You don't know.<br>
