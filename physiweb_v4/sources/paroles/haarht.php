<br>
I am the coming of a new age<br>
Past your shit by far<br>
I was a puzzle in your sick life<br>
But will never be a piece anymore<br>
Because I worked through your fucking bullshit<br>
And I worked through your fucking lies<br>
Now I'm working on the edge<br>
With a thousand times the stress<br>
So I can damn you down to size<br>
<br>
I worked in your fucking warehouse<br>
I worked in your fucking dream<br>
I worked on the edge of the product community<br>
And found that nothing's what it seemed<br>
I fucking hate you....<br>
<br>
Devy worked in the corner of the piss yard<br>
Bored and plagued by pain<br>
Devy got a taste of the corporate community<br>
And never went back again<br>
<br>
I worked for you fucking bastards<br>
I worked for your fucking lies<br>
I went and pissed away too many fucking opportunities<br>
To try and make you fuckers feel right<br>
And I fucking hate you....<br>
<br>
I am the coming of a new age<br>
Stained we still stand tall<br>
I am the coming of a new age<br>
And I will never fall<br>
I bear the questions of a new time<br>
Seen but never heard<br>
I've seen the comings of a new time, get ready...<br>
'Cause here it comes<br>
<br>
Pushing your incompetence<br>
And racial views aside<br>
And never now<br>
Until death again, is there anywhere to... hide<br>
It starts here my friends<br>
My brothers and sisters<br>
The courage to show what is brave, and not be weakened<br>
To stand it through, by any length<br>
To look into the eyes<br>
And have the strength of men who say "fuck you"<br>
I won't do what you tell me...<br>
I don't care who you are...<br>
I'll never stop believing<br>
And I'll never be the one who takes the heat in the name<br>
Of the remorse that isn't pushed into a hole<br>
Waiting now, and packing down<br>
Into the open spaces we must go and not be frightened<br>
As children we came<br>
As children we go<br>
So never look behind you, never look behind... "fuck you"<br>
It isn't a decision...<br>
It's a sign of greater things...<br>
And a loss will never matter...<br>
<br>

Drive<br>
He's trying<br>
To tempt me, take me, down me, rape me, fuck her...<br>
Fuck yourself, you'll never take me live<br>
Goddamn this sun<br>
Go, he's not the one<br>
<br>
Take this away... July, July, July<br>
Bring me rain<br>
<br>
Drive<br>
Keep calm<br>
These are only just illusions<br>
And whatever has been said<br>
It has now gone completely wrong<br>
But keep your head, don't freak...<br>
Keep your eyes upon the road<br>
And just don't think about that room... Oh holy fuck<br>
Oh holy fuck, oh holy fuck<br>
<br>
Goddamn this heat<br>
Christ, goddamn this shit<br>
Take this away... July, July, July<br>
Bring me rain<br>
<br>
He said "I know that you know that I am the one"<br>
"You know that I've found a way..."<br>
Don't die on me, don't leave me alone!!!<br>
Give me this chance and I'll make it the last<br>
I will never succumb<br>
I will never succumb<br>
<br>
Come rain down<br>
Down, down, down...<br>

<br>
Work expectations bind the holy to the wrong<br>
Reflecting what they'll never be<br>
Sing out, pay out another day has come and gone<br>
Get used to the feeling of rotting<br>
<br>
Just watch it, goat boy<br>
You watch it, you're a goat<br>
<br>
Down in the rust steel yard a goat boy loses limb<br>
No need to feed old nan and kids<br>
Old buck he pumps it up, to keep his life from getting low<br>
Then back to compo when he's home<br>
<br>
Just watch the goat boy<br>
Just watch it, you're a goat<br>
Let me hear the goat boy talk!<br>
Don't judge me, goat boy<br>
You watch it, you're a goat<br>

<a name=cmk><b>Cod Metal King</b><br></a>
<br>
Bleeding hearts will never stop<br>
What bleeding lips will start, I'll make your mother<br>
Take your friends, and take your hands<br>
And ride the feeding cart...<br>
<br>
Your little dreams are nothing now<br>
Your dreams are nothing to me, I'll make another<br>
Piece from all the crap around and keep the best for me<br>
I seem never to get the message through<br>
That shit should mean something to you<br>
I tell you brother, it's easy to hold the imaging<br>
Of the cod metal king<br>
<br>
Falling, we're falling... Back at beginnings<br>
Don't mean a thing when you come to the cod metal king<br>
You can't deny the power of the millions who are weak<br>
They never bother to take a look<br>
At what it takes, to get us through the sheep<br>
<br>
3 am<br>
I drive alone<br>
I drive where no one will follow me<br>
I keep it low<br>
Inside my coat<br>
I keep it there for me<br>
And I can't believe<br>
We've pass the point<br>
I can't believe we're through, I take another<br>
Look around<br>
And track it down<br>
And disease was right in you<br>

You pretentious fucking losers<br>
You've got nothing at all<br>
You've got your fingers in your asshole<br>
And your hand on the call<br>
And you talk such fucking horseshit<br>
That it's hard to believe<br>
That you almost make careers out of being naive<br>
<br>
You, you are a fucker 'cause you sold my guitar<br>
You, you are a fucker, seeking fortune in bars<br>
You, you are a fucker, 'cause you say such stupid shit<br>
I've got a better line in pocket lint<br>
That what you've done with it<br>
<br>
So if you are an asshole who pretends to be a friend<br>
Then get your ass in music, you'll be set to the end, ending<br>
And now you've got the nerve to ask me about my temper?<br>
Why yes, I have become a fucking happy camper!<br>
<br>
I hate your fucking faces and your trendy cut hair<br>
I hate the fact you think your job will go anywhere<br>
Because its use is just the same as what I shit into the bowl<br>
Just like the mess between your ears is like the mess in my hole<br>
I hate your loser friends who only come out when it's right<br>
I hate that when it's down you run instead of fight<br>
<br>
I'm set to think your lot in life to test the stronger ones<br>
Will just require some chicken shit and also sneakers for the run<br>
I dig it away, the shit you puked instead of swallowed<br>
In an attempt to try and find the dick instead of the load<br>
So when you move and stand aside my mood will hamper<br>
And yes, I will become a fucking happy camper!<br>
<br>
Stuck in endless winter with your press to keep you sane<br>
Wait for useless numbers to grow useful once again<br>
Where the heat will come again, your flaw grows sick<br>
Your flaw will send, the shit you call your business<br>
To the place that is your end<br>
Stuck in the winter, cold and wet<br>
Your stupid friends have come and went<br>
And you're left behind with your idiot job<br>
And it's far from a prize, you fucking dink<br>
... you're a fucking dink... yeah!<br>
...how's this for punk? Dink!<br>
...suck my cock, you pathetic excuse for a human being<br>
<br>
... you're a neurotic, homophobic, racist dork... You've also got a lot of balls to dick with someone else's life, you fucking pseudo ghetto "boy in the hood" middle class white spoiled rotten bored "gangsta" wanna-be hunk of regenerated red neck bullshit! Thank Christ you don't have to rely on that staggering intellect or dynamic personality to intimidate others, shit for brains. Shut the fuck up, and get out of your parents' house and get a real job, you putz, and for god's sake, quit being such a fucking sheep!!! Now grow the hell up!!!<br>
...dink<br>
<br>
I let it get me down because you're in it for the glory<br>
And I'd rather leave with reason than go dying for a story<br>
And this whole L.A. Rock thing<br>
That the malls are buying up<br>
It doesn't work, it doesn't work<br>
It's so inbred I might throw up...<br>
<br>
And now I'm put into the middle<br>
With the contracts and the bunk, and I always end up<br>
Hearing, "hey, man, punk... Let's have more punk!"<br>
So here I am to do a favour, save some hassle kiss and tell<br>
That either way my music's shit and it ain't ever going to sell<br>
So if you've got the gall to take this shit blown up your ass<br>
And you've got the cash and balls to pump the same crap out in mass<br>
Then hell, I'll stand aside and with your plans I'll never tamper<br>
I'll sit and write you songs and be a fucking happy camper<br>
<br>
Yeah, send me out a contract and in clauses you will lurk<br>
The smaller points so I can give it all and save you work<br>
You say an album's not an album without issues left to hamper...<br>
Well then, fuck<br>
...I guess I am a fucking<br>
...happy<br>
...fucking<br>
...camper<br>

All is calm, and all is right<br>
You took the call, you took the fight<br>
I'm finished here, I'm on the next<br>
This time, this time, this time, this time, you call<br>

All you are, is all you are<br>
All is cold, and all is dead<br>
It's time, it's time, I need, I need you<br>

Help me end my nights here<br>
And help me get this water clear<br>
All is calm and all is lost<br>
You call, you call, you call, you call me<br>

Critic... You're the critic... You're the critic<br>
In the night I lay awake<br>
I know it's cheating baby<br>
But I know I have a right<br>
And in the dawn I see the question<br>
A bleeding wrong forcing right<br>
Sometimes night I can't stop thinking<br>
And I'm calling it a soul strike<br>

Go, now, farb<br>
I wait in the rain for her, stop? No...<br>
I'm quite calm, calm, come, come, calm down<br>

So, you are...<br>

Tell me, I'm your filler boy<br>
So, you are<br>
Call me, I'm your filler<br>
Sill girl, spit it out<br>
We are trying slowly...<br>
Still we try...<br>

Fucking it<br>
Pushing you<br>
Loving life<br>
Packing down<br>
Packing love<br>
Pushing you...<br>
Into you...<br>
Loving life...<br>
Pushing you<br>
Rushing you... Bruising you<br>
<br>
All these calls and rotting lies<br>
Packing down to the bobby girl<br>
"I woke up... I woke up to reach daddy-o"<br>
Will she come?<br>
<br>
Pushing now<br>
Pushing love<br>
Pushing you...<br>

Silent filter<br>

Sucks in the resting<br>
Whipping<br>
Children<br>
Posture frozen god<br>
Hungry muted nations<br>

...skin me...<br>

It's just a feeling I have<br>
It's like a feeling of death<br>
You can't be in it for the cash<br>
You must be in it for life<br>
And if your houes I need<br>
And if the payment is real<br>
And if your mind is at ease<br>
That is the death of music<br>

I watch the way you move<br>
And I count by the way you press your eyes<br>
And by the little things that put you down<br>
Ride the rails to where you are -- help me thank you all<br>
Let me fuck you all, and by the way you bitch and masturbate<br>
The bold ones carry on and on the way your prayer comes up<br>
And have fun -- the way to carry on<br>
<br>
I'm a dog, I know, I'm a dog<br>
<br>
It's the only way, it's the corner stay<br>
Push the freight along and grant them all their little<br>
Goddamn shitty things<br>
In the light it grows, slower than before<br>
"Ten-four, they've got to burn, the 9.3 will come to carry on..."<br>
<br>
Gimme some of your good loving<br>
I need your good loving<br>

Oh, Elvis, yer just standin' there and completely naked<br>
And I's jest thinkin' to m'self<br>
"Goddamn-it boy! You've come a quite a little while for<br>
Such a little country doggie..."<br>

C'mon little kiddies
Have I got a treat for you
At first it tastes all yummy
<br>
Then you start to turn blue<br>
<br>
I'll be back again next week<br>
Bring your friends, we'll have an ice cream treat<br>
Mom don't like it, but he don't give a fuck<br>
Kids come running for Satan's ice cream truck<br>

Come on, and ask your mommy<br>
Your pennies are in hand<br>
If you need more than your tummy<br>
You can get inside my van<br>

<br>
Time waits for no one<br>
No holy saviour came again<br>
It's here now, my old friend<br>
And it's time to go home...<br>
Back to the stars<br>
Now I know how it sounds<br>
But I know how I feel<br>
And this boredom kicks into the aligned<br>
The invisible and the divine<br>
And the lights upon the hill at night<br>
They have followed me young<br>
And into tomorrow<br>

No time for you<br>
Time alone<br>
This time I think I've found it<br>
Goodbye my love<br>
It came for me<br>
I'm going back to Japan<br>
