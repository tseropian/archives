  Falling, watching ships go down<BR>
  Falling, watch it all go down<BR>
  <BR>
  Falling out of line<BR>
  Falling out of time<BR>
  More than meets the eye<BR>
  Murder needs your mind<BR>
  <BR>
  Watching, watch it all flow down<BR>
  Falling, watch it all go down<BR>
  <BR>
  Following by sight<BR>
  Following through night<BR>
  More than a keen eye,<BR>
  Murder needs you<BR>
  <BR>
  And you're not the only one<BR>
  And the battle must be won (out of time)<BR>
  When the seed is in the ground<BR>
  You will see what you have found<BR>
  <BR>
  So let them burn,<BR>
  So let them fires burn<BR>
  (It's tattooed on my face)<BR>
  So let them burn,<BR>
  Just let them go<BR>
  <BR>
  And you're not the only one, child<BR>
  Many battles have been won, child<BR>
  Beyond the sea be on the ground<BR>
  You will seize or you will drown<BR>
  <BR>
  So let them burn,<BR>
  So let them fires burn<BR>

	The rain is one<BR>

	I know you<BR>
    At least i think i do<BR>
    Everything's changed<BR>
    But in the days that are so dark<BR>
    It's wonderful<BR>
    <BR>
    Silently,<BR>
    We let our worries be<BR>
    Quietly,<BR>
    We give our souls to the sea<BR>
    <BR>
    But i never even had a chance to say goodbye<BR>
    I never had a chance to end it all...<BR>
    ...silently...<BR>
    ...carefully...<BR>
    ...quietly...

  What have we learned?<BR>
  From this wee exercise<BR>
  What have we earned?<BR>
  Now that it's over<BR>
  <BR>
  What do we say?<BR>
  What are we doing here?<BR>
  Everythings changed,<BR>
  Everything's stayed the same<BR>
  <BR>
  But it's quiet now, quiet now<BR>
  Cause it's the end of the world<BR>
  <BR>
  What if we've changed?<BR>
  What if we're finished here<BR>
  Can we be saved?<BR>
  Does anybody even care?<BR>
  <BR>
  So many dream<BR>
  So many make the grade<BR>
  So many fail<BR>
  So many fade away<BR>
  <BR>
  Show you've a soul by crying<BR>
  <BR>
  What have we learned,<BR>
  From this wee exercise?<BR>
  What have we lost...loving<br>
