	Hey!<br>
	<br>
	Can you believe this shit people?<br>
	<br>
	All I need is this City in this mind, and I will get by<br>
	Fuck sleep, fuck all of you <br>
	<br>
	Yes, yes, oh<br>
	(Velvet, velvet...)<br>
	<br>
	But I can never look back, because you never get a second chance<br>
	I like people who can take the pressure <br>
	<br>
	Are you listening?<br>
	Are you?<br>
	Fuck yeah!<br>
	<br>
	Our new time has come, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls<br>
	Welcome the fuck home<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
		<a name=newflesh><b>All Hail The New Flesh</b></a><br>
	<br>
	All Hail The New Flesh <br>
	Hey man, I'm going to fuck this shit up<br>
	No fear, no compromise, I want it all<br>
	I will never be afraid<br>
	I'll die for what I believe <br>
	All of you assholes can stay rotting here<br>
	I do not care, I will not be there<br>
	I have got to save myself<br>
	And don't tell me there's no one else<br>
	And all you are is all you are<br>
	I'm so sorry (for you) I'm sorry...<br>
	So all hail the new flesh,<br>
	Because it suits me fine<br>
	Just get away, you motherfuck<br>
	And we'll be back if you come<br>
	For what this means to me, you piece of shit<br>
	I'll see you pigs in hell<br>
	I wanna get out!<br>
	I wanna get out!<br>
	Fuck the fuckers!<br>
	Blizzards, earthquakes and floods<br>
	(and when Venus stayed a night in the town/film?)<br>
	when the whole body of warriors was swallowed up by the earth<br>
	All you are is all you are<br>
	I'm so sorry (for you) I'm sorry...<br>
	All hail the new flesh,<br>
	Because it suits me fine<br>
	It comes again<br>
<br>

<br>
	Oh My Fucking God <br>
	Well, gentlemen,<br>
	a great deal of money has been invested in this project<br>
	and we can't allow it to fail <br>
	There are no difficult tasks<br>
	Each action will simply be adapted to the challenge offered by (a humanitarian?)<br>
	Demons dream of God<br>
	There is no insanity, rather a super sanity<br>
	More suited for life at the end of the 20th century<br>
	Where everything is art<br>
	And everything will try to express it<br>
	Where everything is art<br>
	And everything will try to communicate it<br>
	All intelligent beings sleep the dreaming of dreams<br>
	And they've all come up to meet me tonight<br>
	Although while in the morning, all their wonder and their<br>
	glory was turned ugly and quite simple<br>
	like a venue when you're loading in gear<br>
	This night is where it all changes<br>
	Sexuality, eroticism in asexual persuasions<br>
	Man or woman, makes no difference in the outcome<br>
	No fashion, no tolerance for stupidity or ignorance<br>
	&quot;Adidas&quot; or &quot;The Arch Deluxe&quot;<br>
	And time is now an object now<br>
	Oh My Fucking God<br>
	Oh I'm Fucking God<br>
	Oh My Fucking God<br>
	Oh I'm Fucking God<br>

	Detox <br>
  	(hey, you know) <br>
  	I've got a feeling<br>
  	With the wrong people<br>
  	And I can't control my thoughts<br>
	I wish that I could sleep<br>
  	And just get this over with<br>
  	This is only high school bullshit<br>
	I was warned<br>
  	Absolutely numb<br>
  	No good around people<br>
  	Everyone knows and watches me<br>
	How did I get here tonight?<br>
  	What am I doing here?<br>
  	How did I reach this state?<br>
  	How did I lose my sight?<br>
  	I'm lost<br>
  	I'm freaking<br>
  	And everybody knows<br>
  	Everyone's watching<br>
  	So here's all my hopes and aspirations<br>
  	Nothing but puke<br>
  	God, I'm so lonely<br>
	I'm here tomorrow (tonight, tonight)<br>
  	Wait for me (tonight the fear)<br>
  	How could I be such a stupid bastard?<br>
  	Ah, you dumb bugger<br>
	I just want to feel<br>
	I was warned<br>
  	Absolutely numb<br>
  	No good around people<br>
  	Everyone knows and watches me<br>

<br>
	Devy in the corner of his teen year<br>
	Born to run away<br>
	Children in the middle with the village idiot<br>
	So he never made the potty grade <br>
	Now maybe he pulled a little closer<br>
	Cold in a mousy way<br>
	Boom boom as they came a little closer<br>
	Put a bolt in the curse today<br>
	<br>
	Now Devy has to eat it in his own way<br>
  	Broke in a dirty way<br>
  	Boom boom is the beating that I hear in the night<br>
  	But no one hears, so no one knows and<br>
  	No one<br>
  	No one<br>
  	No one fucks with me<br>
	<br>
	Devy wants a word with the Master<br>
  	No need to run away<br>
  	Down on the road isn't easy<br>
  	But I never would back away<br>
  	Boom boom in the morning with the night sounds<br>
  	No way to run away<br>
  	Boom boom as the boredom of monogamy<br>
  	Hits one more time<br>
	<br>
	No one must know<br>
  	No one must know<br>
  	No one must know<br>
  	No one must know this machine<br>
	<br>
	Devy got a taste of some black shit<br>
  	Born in another way<br>
  	And it probably would have been easy<br>
  	But it never worked out that way<br>
  	Boom boom in the corner with the well-soiled<br>
  	Bound to amalgamate<br>
  	Boom boom as it kills the inhibitions<br>
  	No more games<br>
	No one must know<br>
  	No one must know<br>
  	No one must know<br>
  	No one must know this<br>
  	No one<br>
  	No one<br>
  	No one fucks with me...<br>
	AAA<br>
	No one<br>
  	No one<br>
  	No fucking one<br>
  	No one fucks with me...<br>
	It's time...<br>
  	All I want to do is fuck...<br>

 	On and on, it's on and on<br>
  	On and on, it's on and on<br>
  	And no one knows why, no one knows why <br>
  	New time, new ways<br>
  	New thought, a new age<br>
	<br>
	On and on, it's gone on and on<br>
  	On and on, it's on and on<br>
  	Say goodbye! Say goodbye! Say goodbye! Say goodbye!<br>
	<br>
	No one knows why, no one alive<br>
  	New time, new ways, new thought, new age<br>
	<br>
	Tired of waiting, tired of fighting<br>
  	Tired of waiting for fucking nothing<br>
  	Sick of lying, sick of trying<br>
  	Tired of waiting for fucking nothing<br>
	<br>
	Tired of hating, bored of dying<br>
  	Tired of waking from the dreams of morning<br>
  	Sick of trying, sick of whining<br>
  	Tired of waking from the dreams of morning<br>
	<br>
	Tired of waiting, tired of fighting<br>
  	Tired of waiting for fucking nothing<br>
  	Sick of lying, sick of trying<br>
  	Tired of waiting for fucking nothing<br>

	<br>
	What you don't understand is where everything's leading<br>
  	When all of the signs you see still point to overload<br>
  	As you reach out your hand, a shattered picture's receding<br>
  	Like tail-lights along that lonesome stretch of broken road<br>
  	'Cause you've been to the past and it's just a reminder<br>
  	A recollection of faces that will never come to call <br>
  	When you've cut through the mask, when you've been through the grinder<br>
  	Sometimes you forget that you had ever been there at all<br>
	<br>
	Up here in room 429<br>
  	Seems like the world ain't so unkind<br>
  	I want to take you to that empty room tonight<br>
	<br>
	In the shadow of doubt, in the crush of an instant<br>
  	Standing in the rain outside my door hand on your knife<br>
  	When you reach a brick wall, there is still a decision<br>
  	Always thought if I had to lose I'd surely choose my life<br>
	<br>
	Up here in room 429<br>
  	Seems like the world ain't so unkind<br>
  	I want to take you to that empty room tonight<br>
  	We'll tell the world outside the door<br>
  	That we ain't never coming back no more<br>
  	We're going to stay in here till we turn out the night<br>
  	Till we turn off the night<br>
	<br>
	City breathes so softly, everything is sleeping<br>
  	I am at the window silently watching<br>
  	I can see you standing alone against the winter<br>
  	I can hear you asking but the streets they are not giving
	<br>
	Don't look too the ocean, restless in its dreaming<br>
  	Don't look to the heavens for they will tell you nothing<br>
  	If living is for learning then dying is forgetting<br>
  	Once we have forgotten then we can go on living
	<br>
	In a lifetime of hope, in a second of kindness<br>
  	There is never a doubt that we are born and die alone<br>
  	From within or without there's no way they can find us<br>
  	When they knock at the door the lights are on but we ain't home
	<br>
	Up here in room 429<br>
  	Yeah the world ain't so unkind<br>
  	I want to take you to that empty room tonight<br>
  	We'll tell the world outside the door<br>
  	That we ain't never coming back no more<br>
	<br>
  	I want to stay in here till we turn out the night<br>
  	We're going to stay in here till we turn out the night<br>
  	Till we turn out the night<br>
  	Till we turn out the night<br>

	Spirituality <br>
  	I'm right here where you left me experimenting<br>
  	Bored out of my fucking mind<br>
  	Please give me a sign<br>
  	Please show me a sign<br>
  	Please show me that you're alive <br>
  	There has got to be another way<br>
  	Another place for me<br>
  	Please, help me please<br>
  	You'll never be what you try to be if you want to be it<br>
  	God help the king of nothing<br>
	It's getting late<br>
  	I'm getting old<br>
  	And every night I just sleep, we never talk<br>
  	And every night, I look to the sky<br>
  	And I pray to God they'll hear me<br>
	And if that's all there is<br>
  	If this is it<br>
  	Won't... won't someone tell me<br>
	Because I'm so fucking sick of all you<br>
  	Sick stupid people<br>
