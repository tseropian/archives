<br>
	what have we done everybody?
	i know why and where the water flows<br>
	i know i don't remember anything at all<br>
	i sit in the mountain, sit in the mountain, alone<br>
	sit in the mountain, i know, i know<br>
	'cause i've been there before<br>
	<br>
	stay a while, and let the feelings go...<br>
	stay... stay... don't remember anything today<br>
	sit in the mountain, sit in the mountain alone<br>
	sit in the mountain, i know, i know<br>
	'cause i've been there before<br>
	<br>
	and they say you're out of your mind<br>
	and everything is just fine<br>
    you say you don't want to use me<br>
    so lose me, lose me<br>
	<br>
    i sit in the mountain, sit in the mountain, alone<br>
    sit in the mountain, i know, i know<br>
	'cause we've been there before<br>
	<br>
	stay... stay... stay...
