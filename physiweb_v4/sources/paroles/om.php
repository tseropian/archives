	<a name=Intro><b>Intro</b></a>
	<br>
	Oh Earth, what changes hast thou seen?<BR>
	There, where the long street roars<BR>
	Hath been the stillness of the sensual sea<BR>
	The hills are shadows<BR>
	And they flow from form to form<BR>
	And nothing stands like clouds<BR>
	That shape themselves and go<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<a name=seventh><b>Seventh Wave</b></a>
	<br>
	Running away, running away<BR>
	Running away forever<BR>
	It was her only chance of finding home<BR>
	Running away, running away<BR>
	Running away together...<BR>
	With only thoughts of finding home. I'll wait for the ocean to rise up<BR>
	And meet me as it rose up before<BR>
	(I'll know the time)<BR>
	I'll wait for the ocean to rise up<BR>
	And greet me as it rose up before <BR>
	(I'll know the year) Because you're never alone<BR>
	...Even when you're alone<BR>
	You're never alone… <BR>
	Watch the seventh wave Running away, running away<BR>
	Running into the weather<BR>
	With only thoughts of finding home<BR>
	Running away, running away<BR>
	Running away forever<BR>
	I realize I'm on my own. On my way pass it on<BR>
	On my way pass it on I'll wait for the ocean to rise up<BR>
	And meet me as it rose up before<BR>
	(I'll know the time)<BR>
	I'll wait for the ocean to rise up<BR>
	And greet me as it rose up before We're never alone<BR>
	Even when you're alone<BR>
    We're never alone… watch the ocean.<br>
	<br>

	<a name=life><B>Life</B></a>

	<br>
	My life is all that I've known<BR>
	And its all that keeps me here<BR>
	My time is all that I own<BR>
	So I won't let it slip away… How long can this life go on<BR>
	Who we are what we are…<BR>
	I'll see you on the other side Wouldn't you rather live it on your own<BR>
	Even when it bends you over…<BR>
	So when it comes time to go home<BR>
	You don't let them fade away… How long can this all go on?<BR>
	How long till its over?<BR>
	And how long till it all comes down?<BR>
	And how bad to we need a new reminder? <br>

	<br>
	Here I am, driving through Japan at night<BR>
    Here I am, pretending everything's alright<BR>
    And I've got so far to go before the morn<BR>
    And I can't believe bow much it hurts at home Here I am, living life inside 
    a comic book<BR>
    Here I am, bored with everything... And I can't believe that I'm here to stay<BR>
    Cause I never worked it out this way<BR>
    And I love you more than I can say<BR>
    But I hate you every other way Rain, falling down<BR>
    Rain, falling down<BR>
    Rain, falling down<BR>
    Rain, falling down over me I think I'm closer now<BR>
    I think I'm closer now<BR>
    I'm getting closer now<BR>
    Under the light of the moon And I can't believe that I'm here to <BR>
    Stay, 'cause I never worked it out…<BR>
    And I love you more than I can say<BR>
    But I hate you every other…<BR>
    And I'll keep my world from falling apart <BR>
    In the corner of an aching heart<BR>
    So say you'll come into the city<BR>
    Come back with me please…<br>

	<br>
	Cold blue waves<BR>
	Cold dead sky<BR>
	See in the sea what I need to be<BR>
	Cold blue waves Cold blue mind… (hear them talk about)<BR>
	Cold dead mind See in the sea what is and what will be Every dream I have wants me to stay<BR>
	Every night I try to find a way I hide nowhere<BR>
	They hide in my world<BR>
	I have nowhere to go<BR>
	Dreams come as they…<BR>
	Sleep comes as it…<BR>
	Dreams come as they do<br>

    Caught up in the wire<BR>
    I'm already gone<BR>
    Who's the weakest now? It's the grey days that <BR>
    I'll remember the most<BR>
    It's the grey times in the water <BR>
    Before morning I won't be alone<BR>
    Think of me at night<BR>
    Send my love to home<BR>
    I'll be alright It's the grey days that <BR>
    I'll remember the most<BR>
    It's the grey times in the water <BR>
    Before morning And it's only tonight that <BR>
    I'll be able to leave<BR>
    And it's only the weak<BR>
    That cry for me in morning Because tonight there will be no sleep<BR>
    Tonight to comes for me<BR>
    Please, help them understand<BR>

    From our world, I bring you greetings<BR>
    It's so hard to tame them<BR>
    …it will be so hard to prove them wrong<BR>
    I believe, we'll lose our world for them…<BR>
    I believe, we'd throw up arms before <BR>
    Them…<BR>
    ...And bore them<BR>
    So call it home

	Jesus, here 
    lies my brother<BR>
    Tortured and blown<BR>
    Stretch for the heavens and go<BR>
    …I watch him go<BR>
    Here it comes Jesus was a poor boy<BR>
    Jesus was a poor boy<BR>
    "It's just a spring clean for the May queen"<BR>
    I'm coming home And this one's for the life<BR>
    This one's for the funeral in the rain<BR>
    And id only for tonight<BR>
    This one's for the funeral in the rain The day's gone and the year's gone<BR>
    And I don't know when I'm coming home <BR>
    I can't hold on to what I've had<BR>
    When what I've had <BR>
    There's nothing left at all… So this one's for the life<BR>
    This one's for the funeral in the rain<BR>
    And if only for tonight<BR>
    Close your eyes and try to sleep again… A world away, you turn away<BR>
    I'm wide awake, and I don't need your home<BR>
    Tell me why he went, it seems to be<BR>
    An element to this mystery<BR>
    It's so cold today, so I get away, and I'm left behind with nothing but words...<br>

	Night time, turn around<BR>
    Lonely is the city tonight<BR>
    Night time, all around<BR>
    Lonely in the city tonight Grey people stare at static sky (as you will)<BR>
    Ours is not to question why Same thing, every time<BR>
    It always seems to need what I'm not<BR>
    To all the hopeful ones:<BR>
    Nobody gives a fuck what you've got I only wish that I could pray to god <BR>
    (but you will)<BR>
    Stay longer<BR>
    Please don't leave me alone Bastard, mother, father, no…<BR>
    Time passed quicker than you will ever know<BR>
    And they can push me harder<BR>
    But you know I'll never go<BR>
    And they will justify it, but you know<BR>
    It will take them slow…

	The lights from across 
    the harbor<BR>
    And the boys are out on the corners <BR>
    Sex in the neon basements (red and smelly)<BR>
    And don't feel a thing (it's too cold to worry)<BR>
    So in the corner by the dock<BR>
    Where there's no light<BR>
    It smells like piss but no one knows <BR>
    And right now just to sleep would be alright …Feel old, gone where the 
    feelings go<BR>
    …Gone now in a field of green<BR>
    Gone where feelings go…<br>

		<a name=thedeath><b>The Death of Music</b></a>
	<br>
	Question...<BR>
    Leapt like dog from man...<BR>
    Terminate high thinking...<BR>
    Known in your prophecy... Sun...Son... <BR>
    Sun it shifts, and brittleness subsides<BR>
    To sleep... sleep away One comes, the rain will always be<BR>
    And things I am <BR>
    Are things that should not be<BR>
    They laughed at me but we never bothered My friends and I <BR>
    There were no others Now it comes...<BR>
    Bold across the blue...<BR>
    Shadows dance over the land...<BR>
    Walls high, water deep<BR>
    Brick and steel gathering speed<BR>
    Guess it's just a feeling<BR>
    ....Guess it's just a feeling... Rain may come <BR>
    The rain may never be<BR>
    In things you are<BR>
    Are things I need to be<BR>
    My friends were there but they never bothered Now there's you and I and <BR>
    There are no others It's like when death becomes musical <BR>
    ...It's musical<BR>
    It's like a death becomes musical <BR>
    Musical And it comes...<BR>
    To make sure that he will never rise<BR>
    And the groans from the bellies<BR>
    Have never cried this hard<BR>
    And the eyes of the wicked ones<BR>
    Have never been full of dust<BR>
    In the middle of the sea it waits... <BR>
    ....Closer... Home, nor anywhere on Earth on that final day will anyone be 
    apart<BR>
    ...one... schooled... together...<BR>
    Towards the sea... <BR>
    And we may drown, fly, fall from faith<BR>
    ...but the pain won't be realized<BR>
    Because the emotions will hit as god should <BR>
    And the mountains will offer no shelter<BR>
    And the clouds will be no cover...<BR>
    No matter where we run... Don't die on me<BR>
    Don't go away<BR>
    When I need you here<BR>
    In my need The rain will come<BR>
    The rain will always be<BR>
    In things I am <BR>
    Are things that have to be<BR>
    My friends have come and I never bothered Myself and I <BR>
    There is no other It's like a death becomes musical <BR>
    It's musical  </p>

	<a name=thing><b>Thing Beyond Things</b></a>
	<br>
	Once when I 
    was young, I used to dream for hours and hours<BR>
    I'd dream a world that wasn't small…<BR>
    And I'd travel to a valley where under tress and earth <BR>
    I'd set my girl…<BR>
    …And I knelt down by her head<BR>
    And lay roses in her hair and I kissed her gently…<BR>
    But this is what you are<BR>
    As the sun sets in my eyes I know…<BR>
    I know I know I know I know I know And I know this one's the light<BR>
    And the worm inside of me <BR>
    Is the oldest wound that I've nursed along<BR>
    … So don't try to get inside <BR>
    These things inside are wrong, things beyond things It's sick now<BR>
    It's rotten to the core, it's eyes bulge and gaze at me…<BR>
    …Lovingly…<BR>
    And I remember this smell from my dreams except it was sweeter then…<BR>
    And even in this room, where I used to lock my secrets <BR>
    It's starting to smell just like my friend<BR>
    And I told you not to breathe, so now I sit and watch the rain, I know<BR>
    I know I know I know I know I know I know I know And I know this one's the 
    dark<BR>
    And the woman inside of me, is the oldest wound that<BR>
    I've nursed along…<BR>
    So don't try to get inside<BR>
    These things inside are all just things.
