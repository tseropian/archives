I warned you<br>
  Hallelujah<br>
  Hello... it's back<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name=chris><b>Christeen</b></a><br>
<br>
Running, beyond the speed of sound<br>
  Calling, beyond the speed of sound<br>
  Say you love me, say you love yourself<br>
  Say you need me, say you care<br>
  Say you want me, say you want yourself<br>
  Say you want to be with me well<br>
<br>
Christeen, that's all I ask of you<br>
<br>
Falling, into the open doorway<br>
  Loving, what anyone else would loathe here...<br>
  Say you're with me, say you're with yourself<br>
  Say you're lonely, say you care<br>
  Say you warned me, say you warned yourself<br>
  Say you want to be with me well<br>
  <br>
Christeen, that's all I ask of you<br>
<br>
Are you feeling okay?<br>
  Are you feeling so much pain<br>
  That never goes away<br>
  Oh, we know, and we're feeling so much better than before<br>
  What's more, is that feeling isn't failing anymore...<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name=bd><b>Bad Devil</b></a><br>
<br>
I wanna know what you all<br>
  Had for dinner<br>
  I wanna watch the rodeo<br>
  I wanna big city boy<br>
  Be a man, not a boy<br>
  I'm gonna meet you on down<br>
  Beside the bayou<br>
<br>
I wanna be in your little friend<br>
  I wanna live in your underpants<br>
  I wanna big city boy<br>
  Be a man, not a boy<br>
  I'm gonna meet you on down beside the bayou<br>
<br>
  And we'll see how it feels when it's over<br>
  And we'll see how it feels when I'm older<br>
  'Cause it's all just a waste of time<br>
  So enjoy what's on my mind<br>
  (Someone should have said)<br>
<br>
Train won't stop<br>
  Never gonna stop<br>
  And it's coming back to carry me back home<br>
  Leave me alone<br>
  With no where to go<br>
  And ride that wind back home...<br>
  <br>
  Bad devil<br>
  Bad double-decker devil<br>
  <br>
Cry for me baby<br>
  Lie for me baby<br>
  Lay down before me baby<br>
  And ride that wind back home<br>
  <br>
Bad devil<br>
  And I've seen how I'll feel when it's over<br>
  And I've seen how I'll feel when I'm older<br>
  And it's not just a waste of time<br>
  So enjoy what's on my mind<br>

<a name=war><b>War</b></a><br>
  <br>
In the morning 'bout three or so<br>
  Can't stop thinking about what I know<br>
  In the morning 'bout three or so<br>
  Can't stop thinking of the universe<br>
  <br>
I keep rocking, I keep rolling<br>
  Trade in the minute for a minute that isn't there<br>
  Keep dropping, keep rolling<br>
  Put out the fire with the water<br>
  Thinking creosote<br>
  <br>
I the morning with a beat up bud I know<br>
  I can't fight a war without losing blood<br>
  <br>
In the morning 'bout three or so<br>
  Can't stop seeking what I need to know<br>
  God is in the mountain as is in the rock<br>
  And god is not concerned about keeping stock<br>
  <br>
So keep rocking, keep rolling<br>
  Trade in the minute for a minute that isn't there<br>
  Keep dropping, keep rolling<br>
  Put out the fire with the water<br>
  Thinking creosote<br>
  <br>
All he ever wanted was to be alone<br>
  But you can't feel love without being loved!!<br>
  <br>
(Can't fight a war without losing blood)<br>
  (Blood... Blood... Blood...)<br>
  All we ever wanted was love<br>
  Love! (doo wop boddum... doo wapideewapideewapideedoo...)<br>
  We can see the enemy, they say...<br>
  Hey! we don't want your war!<br>
  It's quite nice, white light, it's quite, it's quite extraordinary!<br>
  Window! It's a window! It's white! It's quite... quite...<br>
  God, quiet! Just a little bit of quiet please!<br>
  <br>
Just stop the noise for once... please!!<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name=sd><b>Soul Driven</b></a><br>
  <br>
Now that the love is gone<br>
  What's still holding on?<br>
  If all that was said was true...<br>
  What's still holding you?<br>
  If ever, you need someone there<br>
  Who's been there for ever<br>
  And ever, will waken the dawn<br>
  Awaken the dawn for you...<br>
  <br>
Please don't hesitate to call<br>
  Please don't hesitate at all...<br>
  Please don't hesitate to call<br>
  Please don't hesitate at all<br>
(So many words, which ones do you say?)<br>
<br>
Sing mauté dingas!<br>
  (Everyone who knows and everyone who noticed...<br>
  Anyone who noticed anyone who knows it...)<br>

The birth has occurred and the time has begun, it's the end of this age and 
  the preparations must begin for a new time that takes so much work and will 
  hurt in the beginning, change always does, and know strength is not something 
  you buy or sell through aggression and fear. Only love and acceptance of faith 
  will convince you that you're not alone and exist among friends so have patience...<br>
  <br>
Don't give in...<br>
  Don't give in...<br>
  Have patience...<br>
-- It's time<br>
  (Is this what you want? Are you happy with what we've<br>
  become? Is this the way you want to live?)<br>
...you have a decision to make<br>
  Bodywash! Home everybody e-a<br>
  Everybody knows, it's very good now... home... home...<br>
  <br>
  <br>
<a name=ants><b>Ants</b></a><br>
Alive, but so alone...<br>
  Live, so alive...<br>
  All we need is money just a little bit of money, and that's all<br>
  that we've been searching for<br>
  (Make the money! Do the laundry!)<br>
  Just a little bit of money makes the world go round<br>
  <br>
<a name=cb><b>Colonial Boy</b></a><br>
  <br>
If you ever need a friend in me<br>
  ...ever need a friendly deed<br>
  Please don't ever let me<br>
  Slip away<br>
  What I'll miss in the travesty<br>
  Is easier than it needs to be<br>
  <br>
Please don't ever let me slip away<br>
  Because it's cold in the fantasy<br>
  I'd do or say anything<br>
  Sell me, tell me, I'm wild<br>
  (I'm wild)<br>
  As I am in the fantasy<br>
  I'll do or say anything<br>
  I dance for thee 'cause we<br>
  All enjoy a wild colonial boy<br>
  -Cats- Time! Time!<br>
  Paddington, Paddington<br>
  That's the saviour<br>
  Awe saw sale ya!<br>
  Watch the boy he feels it all<br>
  Watch the boy he heals it all<br>
  <br>
  <br>
<a name=dyn><b>Dynamics</b></a><br>
Winter hides the dead<br>
  Just like summer ends too soon<br>
  Springing forth the new knowing<br>
  Autumn is the tomb<br>
  <br>
And I'll wait for you<br>
  'Cause it's waiting for you<br>
  Living hides the dead just like<br>
  Suns and earth and moon<br>
  Springing forth the new knowing<br>
  Flowers need to bloom<br>
  <br>
And I'll wait for you<br>
  'Cause it's waiting for you<br>
  Unsure? Well, here's help with the wait<br>
  The heavens move and the earth will quake<br>
  And now god has failed and a metaphor<br>
  There's only awe forever more<br>
  <br>
Life is all dynamics<br>
  Life is all... dynamics<br>
  There's life in all dynamics<br>
  <br>
Life is all dynamic</b></a><br>
<br>
Unsure? Well, here's help with the weight<br>
  There's only &quot;god&quot; for &quot;heaven's&quot; sake<br>
  There's only one key to unlock the door<br>
  You must get by the metaphor<br>
  (God help our mother... love one another!)<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name=un><b>Unity</b></a><br>
Life, it's all life<br>
  It's all alive<br>
  It's alright now<br>
  We're home<br>
  Home, home, home...<br>
Light, it's all light<br>
  It's all lies<br>
  It's a life<br>
  It's all right, now we're home<br>
<br>
<br>
  <a name=npb><b>Noisy Pink bubbles</b></a><br>
You and I<br>
  Will never be falling for, reality<br>
  You and I, and every being<br>
  Falling for reality...<br>
  You and I, must never mean<br>
  Falling into alcohol<br>
  You for you, and all for you...<br>
(People who are predisposed to schizophrenia can be pushed into the condition 
  through the use of marijuana)<br>
  You can never tell by the face<br>
  When they're starting to go...<br>
And you, make all my words go away<br>
  And you, take all my time<br>
  But you, make all the hurt go away<br>
  And all I can say it it's day<br>
  After day, all I know...<br>
-Yeah-<br>
<br>
Fine, fine, fine<br>
<br>
So you, make all these dreams go away<br>
  And you, help me do time<br>
  Can you, make all the love go away<br>
  ...'Cause all I can say is it's day<br>
  After day, god I know<br>
  <br>
Fine, fine, just leave me alone<br>
  Just let me go away<br>
  Just go away<br>
  <br>
Just go...<br>
