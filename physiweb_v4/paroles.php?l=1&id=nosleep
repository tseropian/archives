Devin makes up the words to this song as he goes along and cannot remember
what he said the night of the recording. There will possibly be permanent lyrics 
for a studio recording on the next Strapping record. In the meantime, here is 
an interpretation of Devin's lyrics</i></b><br>
<br>
  King Raul beat off<br>
  King Raul wank<br>
  King Raul beat off<br>
  King wank<br>
  Out in the cold with my neck rope on (definitely not that)<br>
  You're a fucking asshole<br>
  One time and I'm outta control<br>
  Yeah you fucking suck...hey!<br>
  King Raul beat off<br>
  King Raul wank<br>
  King Raul beat off<br>
  King wank<br>
  Out in the cold when we're not away (see above)<br>
  You're a fucking pussy!<br>
  One time and I'm outta control<br>
  Yeah you fucking suck, shit<br>
  King Raul beat off<br>
  King Raul wank<br>
  King Raul beat off<br>
  King wank<br>
  Can't wait to feel it again<br>
  Can't wait to feel home<br>
  When I was somebody else<br>
  Well I was just a boy<br>
  Come on!<br>
  The purpose of this exercise is to accentuate the cheesier parts!<br>
  Now in the halls of the Necro-Lord<br>
  Flash of fear when he sees my sword<br>
  I raped his women, smoked his bone<br>
  Leave a booger underneath his throne<br>
  King Raul beat off<br>
  King Raul wank<br>
  King Raul beat off<br>
  King Raul fucking wank<br>
  Can't wait to feel it again<br>
  Can't wait to feel home<br>
  When I was somebody else<br>
  Well I was just a boy<br>
<br>

  <br> 
  Time waits for no one<br>
  No holy saviour came again<br>
  It's here now, my old friend<br>
  And it's time to go home...<br>
  Back to the stars<br>
  Now I know how it sounds<br>
  But I know how I feel<br>
  And this boredom kicks into the aligned<br>
  The invisible and the divine<br>
  And the lights upon the hill at night<br>
  They have followed me young<br>
  And into tomorrow No time for you<br>
  Time alone<br>
  This time I think I've found it<br>
  Goodbye my love<br>
  It came for me<br>
  I'm going back to Japan<br>
  <br>

  <br>
  So what man?<br>
  So what?<br>
  It leaves me too low...<br>
  And it pushes me out<br>
  It leaves me behind<br>
  <br>
  ...all of my life<br>
  ...all of my days<br>
  Your woman...<br>
  So what?<br>
  She leaves me in doubt<br>
  And pushes me down<br>
  It leaves me behind<br>
  ...all of my life<br>
  ...all of my days<br>
  All that I'm going through<br>
  Your legs when these would do<br>
  ...know when it's over<br>
  This &quot;no one&quot; left no one behind <br><br>&nbsp;
